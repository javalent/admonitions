The Admonition plugin for Obsidian is a tool that allows you to create attention-grabbing callouts, tips, warnings and other informative blocks within your notes. The plugin provides a range of pre-defined icons to pick from, as well as the ability to create your own custom styles using CSS. You can customize and style to fit your specific needs, and can target each iteration independently using the `.callout` and `.admonition` selectors.

## Features

- Supports a variety of built-in admonition types such as tip, warning, caution, note, and more.
- Customizable styles with the ability to use Markdown attributes in callouts, or stylize directly with CSS.
- Supports nesting of blockquotes and code-blocks.
- Admonitions can flourish in combination with other plugins such as Obsidian **[Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates)** or @SilentVoid13's **[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)**.
- Supports import and export of custom admonitions via `.json` files.

### Quickstart

1. Install the Admonition plugin from the Community Plugins pane in Obsidian.
2. **Callout Version**: In the editor, type out the name of an admonition type (such as >[!tip]) followed by your content.
3. **Admonition Version**: In the editor, type out the name of an admonition type in a code block `(such as ```ad-tip)` followed by your content on the subsequent lines. 
4. Ensure three backticks close your codeblock.
5. Preview your note to see the formatted admonition.


````yaml
```ad-tip
title: This is a tip

This is the content of the admonition tip.
```
````
